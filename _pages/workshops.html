      <p>This summer school took place in camping Rovies in North Euboea. The participants had a pleasant time in camping where they discussed issues which are not analyzed in details in normal course of studies. In mornings the participants discussed the session of posters and they were hanging together at coffee, beach or lunch and in the evenings, there was the sessions of lectures in the following issues:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Artificial intelligence & 3D printing</li>
        <li>Infrastructures and landscapes</li>
        <li>Climate change</li>
        <li>Wildfires and floods. Risks in social cohesion</li>

      <p>This workshop discusses the energy mix and the feasibility of Renewable Energy (RE) installations. In addition, analyzes the impact of RE installations in landscape aesthetics. Related digital tools, which can minimize the negative effect of landscape transformation by RE are also presented. In conclusion, this workshop highlights the significant role or energy installations which are strongly correlated with prosperity. These conclusions are presented in a symbolic sculpture performance entitled: Too many Don Quixotes but only one wind mill</p>

      <p>After the previous editions, the Winter School will be focused on the same main topic: the
        relationship between geometry and structure so called Structural Morphology.
        The specific focus of this edition is the study of how geometrical shape influences force flows into
        the structural elements for different applications. With this project, we aim to study methods,
        strategies and techniques recently developed employed to incrementally change assembly
        buildings and spaces depending on the influence of the sites strictly correlated to the culture
        belonging to the design location</p>

          <p>Josh Mason is an Associate Partner within the Specialist Modelling Group (SMG) at Foster + Partners, the practice’s multi-disciplinary research and development group. With experience in fabrication and computation, Josh joined in 2012 to assist the team with the delivery of complex projects from design to construction and operation. He has a Masters of Arts from the Architectural Association and a Bachelors of Science from Columbia University.
            Josh is a specialist in parametric design and BIM workflows across a range of software platforms and design applications. He has assisted teams on a broad spectrum of architectural and research projects from design through construction including the development of large-scale, structural steel additive and subtractive manufacture for metal (LASIMM). With a background in fabrication, mechanical and civil engineering, his work aims to integrate performance requirements into flexible design models informed by an understanding of the long-term impacts of early-stage decisions.</p> -->
