        <p>The Networkâ€™s goal is to nurture competent researchers, highly trained engineers and scientists. To achieve this, ADDOPTML will put in place research interactions that will expose all involved parties to interdisciplinary research activities taking place in institutions and SMEs from seven EU-MS and one Third Country. Furthermore, it sets to provide more than 30 early stage researchers and engineers with the opportunity to be trained by world leading academic and industrial experts and acquire skills in Additive Manufacturing, Engineering Optimization, Machine Learning, and Generative design and in particular its application to AECI. Thus, through the envisaged training exchanges, the human scientific capital will have the opportunity to acquire highly sought skills, knowledge and technical experience in the domain of state-of-the-art methods in Structural, Shape & Topology (S&T), and Multidisciplinary Optimization. The interaction between the 14 partners is presented schematically in the following Figure.</p>

        <p>The work to be carried out in this project will be subdivided into seven overlapping research topics which will constitute the corresponding work packages (WP1-WP7), while one additional work package is devoted to training activities (joint diploma theses, international conferences and workshops/seminars along with communication, dissemination and exploitation activities) and one WP for management and coordination. This interaction plan, which is in accordance with the expertise of the research groups of the partner organizations described in detail (in Sections 4.4 and 6), guarantees that the complementarity of the expertise will be achieved and synergies between partners will be fully exploited for accomplishing the project objectives.</p>
        <p>The partners involved in the project belong to high level research organizations and the scientists in charge are leading experts in their respective scientific fields. They have an important and complementary research activity focusing on:</p>
