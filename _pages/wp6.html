              <td>AM technology using concrete has several advantages related to the AECI sectors; such as economic, environmental, social and engineering beneﬁts. Furthermore, this technology allows developing innovative applications and complex design of buildings, housing modules, bridges and urban and domestic furniture elements. The aim of WP6 is to design/manufacture a structure which combines energy-efficient design with renewable energy sources, insulation, air and moisture barriers, and exterior cladding into one shell. An optimized 3D printed model for habitation that responds to the increasingly urgent climate revolution and gives possibilities for human shelter off-the-grid or re-house with a permanent house those affected by natural disasters.</td>

                <p>Concerning the necessity of constructions of lower costs, with small footprint and reduction in waste production the solutions provided for post-disaster permanent housing constructions, will be explored in order to develop a practical and cost-effective solution that enables fast construction and solves housing problems. The results from WP2 tests for concrete specimens will be used in order to finalize the material’s strength and cost. Regarding roofing of the typical 3D-printed concrete housing solutions for permanent re-construction, lightweight conventional constructions comprising local materials, such as wood or bamboo, will be compared to deployable solutions, such as the scissor-based and/or origami-inspired lattice structure developed in WP5.</p>

                  <li>Problem formulation Part: Task 6.1 Analysis-Sustainability-Design criteria: Aspects of enhancing the mechanical performance, durability, and sustainability and establishment of appropriate standard guidelines for concrete printing structures will be developed, (Lead by IDONIAL).</li>
                  <li>Problem solution Part: Task 6.2 Implementation of the ADDOPTML framework & Certification: Design of optimised efficient structures will be developed based on the ADDOPTML framework, (Lead by NTUA).</li>
                  <li>Problem solution Part: Task 6.3 Case study - manufacturing: Solution to the housing crisis with reduced consumption of natural resources and energy, reduced pollution of the environment, (Lead by IDONIAL).</li>
                  <li>Manufacturing Part: Task 6.4: Usage of recycled materials with concrete matrix for advanced 3D printing application: The main objective of this task is to introduce an integrated hybrid consolidation process, capable of reducing printing times by combining advanced concrete material 3D printing with higher-speed deposition of recycled material as filler, reinforce or support (depending on the material itself), (Lead by IDONIAL).</li>
                  <li>Manufacturing Part: Task 6.5 Vibration measurements: In order to assess and verify the structural performance of the 3D printed prototype, vibration measurements will be performed, (Lead by STRUCTURES & SENSORS).</li>
