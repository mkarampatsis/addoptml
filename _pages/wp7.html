                  <li>Task 7.1 AM for applications in Space: This task will establish the requirements for the relevant materials to be used for AM in the different targeted environments: LEO, GEO / deep space, and lunar surface conditions, (Lead by SPACEAPPS).</li>
                  <li>Task 7.2 Case Study: Optimization of MOSAR-WM manipulator relying on AM: This task proposes to study specifically the optimization of the MOSAR-WM manipulator based on AM, with a particular focus on joint and structural elements, (Lead by SPACEAPPS).</li>
                  <li>Task 7.3: Case Study: Optimization of HOTDOCK standard interface relying on AM: This task proposes to study specifically the optimization of the HOTDOCK standard interface based on AM. Affordability and reliability of the resulting design are key aspects, to quantify, (Lead by SPACEAPPS).</li>
                  <li>Task 7.4: Case Study: Optimization of LUVMI-X lunar rover relying on AM This task proposes to study specifically the optimization of the LUVMI-X rover platform based on AM, (Lead by SPACEAPPS).</li>
