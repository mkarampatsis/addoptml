              <td>In this WP the ADDOPTML optimization and machine learning aided additive manufacturing framework will be developed, aiming to work as a prototype generator. This framework aims to function as a combination of guided but intuitive at the same time prototyping applications from the starting point of drafting a design to the final part of 3D printing construction. The process of interdisciplinary design directly related to optimized design of structures enables investigation, development and effective management of the complexity of the systems through modelling and simulation processes of interrelated form, materials and structural components. The development of optimized structures may be achieved on the basis of performance-based design, primarily formulated through individual automated fabrication criteria. The investigation of different modes of design operation and interactive development of the disciplines involved, comprise the specific Tasks of WP4. This framework requires the collaboration of architects, structural engineers, 3D printing and optimization specialists in a knowledge transfer manner.</td>

                <p>WP3 is composed of three parts: (1) Development, (2) Application and (3) Verification. The process of interdisciplinary design directly related to optimized design of structures enables investigation, development and effective management of the complexity of the systems through modelling and simulation processes of interrelated form, materials and structural components. The development of optimized structures may be achieved on the basis of performance-based design, primarily formulated through individual automated fabrication criteria. The investigation of different modes of design operation and interactive development of the disciplines involved, comprise the specific Tasks of the WP:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Development Part: Task 3.1 the ADDOPTML optimization and machine learning aided additive manufacturing framework: The ADDOPTML proposed framework will be composed by three steps: (i) problem formulation, (ii) problem solving, and (iii) 3D printing of optimized forms, (Lead by NTUA).</li>
                  <li>Application Part: Task 3.2 Case studies: The scope of this Task is to define the characteristic case studies that will be used as the basis to test and calibrate the ADDOPPML framework, (Lead by UCY). </li>
                  <li>Application Part: Task 3.3 Methodologies of interdisciplinary and parametric design (Formulation):. Key aspects of performance-based design will be identified and investigated together with the implicated modes of operation with regard to the nonlinearity and iteration degree of the design process, (Lead by NTUA).</li>
                  <li>Application Part: Task 3.4 Performance-based interdisciplinary and parametric design-based engineering optimization (Solution): In this task, the syntax of Interdisciplinary Design following optimization processes will be examined and methodologies of nonlinear design development and fabrication technique integration will be evaluated with regard to their efficiency of development and performance achieved within the final results, (Lead by UCY).</li>
                  <li>Application Part: Task 3.5 Additive manufacturing (3D printing): This task will be concentrated on the investigation and development of physical prototyping methods based on Additive Manufacturing that can be applied in various scales of suggested structural components, (Lead by MX3D BV).</li> 
                  <li>Application Part: Task 3.6 New 3D printing approaches: New printing approaches will be studied for Laser-Based Powder Bed Fusion (PBF-LB) working paradigm, (Lead by IDONIAL).</li>
                  <li>Verification Part: Task 3.7 Verification of numerically designed 3D-printed structural elements, connections and structures with experimental tests: After defining the ADDOPTML framework, itâ€™s processes will be evaluated with the production of small scale prototypes for visualization purposes as well as larger scale prototypes close to the actual scale of the structures are necessary, (Lead by NTUA).</li>
                  <li>Verification Part: Task 3.8 Vibration measurements and interpretation for experimental testing: In order to experimentally verify the structural models that will be proposed and also explore the adequacy of the continuum and other hypotheses, vibration measurements will be performed, (Lead by STRUCTURES & SENSORS).</li>
