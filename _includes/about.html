                Additive Manufacturing (AM) has attracted the interest of industry due to its potential for flexible and automated production of complex geometry objects, in combination with minimizing time required to develop new products. According to recent analysis, the market for AM products is projected to grow annually by 18%. Although AM technologies are an integral part of digitized industrial production and therefore the 4th industrial revolution; Architectural, Engineering & Construction Industry (AECI) is reluctant to adopt AM technologies in design and construction of buildings, bridges etc. Since 80's AECI has been a pillar industry, now its scale expands and its impact on the global economy is significant. Nevertheless, some issues are exposed to its rapid development, which contributes to a large amount of waste production, huge energy consumption and severe environmental pollution. The recent Green New Deal for Europe sets as a primary objective the reform of heavy industry, including AECI, which accounts for 40% of the energy consumed on the continent. The main tools for achieving this objective are to minimize both materials used and amount of AECI waste. The principal aim of ADDOPTML Network is to create and test an holistic machine learning aided optimum design-manufacturing process of civil structures by developing strong synergies among a multi-disciplinary team of academic experts and SMEs from Belgium, Cyprus, Germany, Greece, Italy, Jordan, Netherlands and Spain. This will be achieved taking advantage of ongoing progress in AM technologies including recycled consumables. Contributing among others to the great challenge becoming Europe the world's first climate-neutral bloc by 2050. In addition, as coronavirus pandemic continues to sweep the World, many countries are facing shortage of intensive care units and emergency rooms; an integrated structural design framework based on AM optimized structural elements for transitional structures will be developed.
